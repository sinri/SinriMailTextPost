        <h1>Sinri Mail Text Post</h1>
        <p>
            This Mac App just provides you a swift entrance to send simple emails through SMTP protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why not use a complete Mail Client?
            They are fat, and some POP3/IMAP servers work not so good with maxOS,
            such as cert issues would come up,
            or they would pull too many mails and store them on your disk which is not necessary,
            and you just want to send, not receive.
